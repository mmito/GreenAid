With the development of our project, I aim to enhance my abilities to cooperate on a team in order to find the best and most efficient solutions to whatever issue we will face.

Maximising group efforts in a smart, intelligent way will be key in achieving this goal, thus I'm looking forward to discovering how we'll be able to optimally distribute the significant workload among each one of us. The presence of deadlines will serve to the purpose of accustoming us to working under pressure, as the necessity to present demos will spur us to constantly remain on track with what should be done.

The final report/project presentation part, furthermore, will greatly help me to maintain the general overview of our product as a whole, plus discussing it and answering questions in front of a panel will challange us to what we could encounter during our present and future working experiences.

Although I have a non-coding background and my programming journey started with the OOP course, I realy enjoy coding and programmig as they are like endless oasises without a limit. In this project, I aim not only to improve my coding and creative thinking skills, I also want to learn how a project team is managed and how different people get along with each other in a long process. In this aspect, I think this project is a nice representation of what's done in real companies: Team up, Think, Design, Code.

To be precise, I want to contribute to the functionality, interface and database parts of the project as I think that I lack some knowledge on these parts and that this project will help me discover tons of new aspects. 

As a team, we have great ideas to realize, and I can't wait to create this application of going green.

My first steps in coding were only on September, when the bachelor started. However, being a fast learner helped me a lot; I was able to catch up with everything on Java. 

My main goal is pretty basic: seeing how we will be able to manage a project of that size with, I hope, no issues in the communication part! 

My weakest points would be that I am stubborn sometimes, and also that I am impatient. But don't worry, being able to counter these points is part of my main goal.
Also, my strong points would be that I am organised and, as I already said, I am a fast learner.

I hope that, as a team, we will be able to get along with everything, with every deadlines done on time, etc.

The things that I want to improve during these 9 weeks is having the opportunity to touch on new parts of Java. The new parts being the GUI, for example.

With this project I aim to improve my programming skills and my ability to work as a team. I am good at communicating with team members which will definitely help me cooperate with my fellow team mates.

I am planning on improving my programming by trying to implement ideas that I have for this project with of course the help of other team members. 

With this project I want to learn more about the server and how to contribute more to making a interface, since I think I still lack those capabilities to be able to make a really good interface.
