With the development of our project, I aim to enhance my abilities to cooperate on a team in order to find the best and most efficient solutions to whatever issue we will face.

Maximising group efforts in a smart, intelligent way will be key in achieving this goal, thus I'm looking forward to discovering how we'll be able to optimally distribute the significant workload among each one of us. The presence of deadlines will serve to the purpose of accustoming us to working under pressure, as the necessity to present demos will spur us to constantly remain on track with what should be done.

The final report/project presentation part, furthermore, will greatly help me to maintain the general overview of our product as a whole, plus discussing it and answering questions in front of a panel will challange us to what we could encounter during our present and future working experiences.

Although I have a non-coding background and my programming journey started with the OOP course, I realy enjoy coding and programmig as they are like endless oasises without a limit. In this project, I aim not only to improve my coding and creative thinking skills, I also want to learn how a project team is managed and how different people get along with each other in a long process. In this aspect, I think this project is a nice representation of what's done in real companies: Team up, Think, Design, Code.

To be precise, I want to contribute to the functionality, interface and database parts of the project as I think that I lack some knowledge on these parts and that this project will help me discover tons of new aspects. 

As a team, we have great ideas to realize, and I can't wait to create this application of going green.

My first steps in coding were only on September, when the bachelor started. However, being a fast learner helped me a lot; I was able to catch up with everything on Java. 

My main goal is pretty basic: seeing how we will be able to manage a project of that size with, I hope, no issues in the communication part! 

My weakest points would be that I am stubborn sometimes, and also that I am impatient. But don't worry, being able to counter these points is part of my main goal.
Also, my strong points would be that I am organised and, as I already said, I am a fast learner.

I hope that, as a team, we will be able to get along with everything, with every deadlines done on time, etc.

The things that I want to improve during these 9 weeks is having the opportunity to touch on new parts of Java. The new parts being the GUI, for example.

With this project I aim to improve my programming skills and my ability to work as a team member. I am good at communicating with other team members which will definitely help me cooperate with my fellow team mates.

I am planning on improving my programming by trying to implement ideas that I have for this project with of course the help of other team members. 

With this project I want to learn more about the server and how to contribute more to make an interface, since I think I still lack those capabilities to be able to make a really good interface.

I was personally waiting for this course since I started my bachelor. I've been involved to some projects in the past, similar to this one let's say, in teams of 5-15 people, and in my opinion this is how you gain a lot of experience in:
1. Programming
2. Teamwork

And these are actually the main points of a good Programmer.

I've started programming 4-5 years ago with C/C++ and since then I experienced some other languages like Java, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS etc. During this proccess of learning I've seen my strong and weak points and of course, my likes and dislikes.

I like programming and especially I like algorithms, functionalities and anything that has to do with the main core of the applicaton. On the other hand, I don't find myself a very creative person in terms of design. I don't personally like to design a webpage, or to make anything look nicer, to improve the visual of an application. I care more about efficiency and functionality, I like to make something work properly, as fast as possible and without bugs. Even though I am not very good in designing an application, I am sure my teammates will help me and we will together develop a really nice application.

My goal is to develop a fully functional Java application, a complete product that can prove me I am on the right way of building a strong career in IT. Moreover, I am also aiming for a very high grade, hopefully a 10, since this is no longer an Exam based course. This course will truly show us our value, our willing to do something in the right way, with strict deadlines and our capability to work proffesionally, in a team.

After I met my teammates I am pretty sure everything will be ok, because I saw everyone really excited about the project itself and I feel each and every one of us will put in a lot of effort. So even though the teamwork is hard in general, I feel it won't be that hard for us.

Two things are important when working in a project:
- being a teamplayer
- have a clear understanding what needs to be done (communication)

I am also a non-coder. I am more of a systems (OS) Guy.

I will try to do my best and contribute the best way possible to this project and team.

This project isn't just about programming, it is mostly about being able to work together as a team. 
I am trying to improve my ability to work in a team when working on a shared programming goal as well as improve my general understanding of programming itself.
I think that this project will really help us prepare for programming jobs in the future since this asks far more from every member of the team than ever before.
Getting the team to work together as an efficient machine will be the main task, and i would love to make this possible.
I think i have the creativity and team work capabilities to make a great application, yet i still need to learn a lot about programming itself and more importantly programming in a team.
